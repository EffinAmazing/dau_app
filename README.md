# Block Setup

This block is designed to be used with Segment data collected through the Segment track method and attributed to a `user_id`. After some quick setup you'll be able to see daily, weekly, and monthly active users for any event you're tracking to Segment. You can also analyze the frequency of engagement and retention of users on the tracked feature in your site or app.

1. Enter your Segment schema name into the [manifest](/projects/dau_app/files/manifest.lkml).
2. Input the `event` strings for the events you want to analyze as active events into the [event parameter in the DAU view](/projects/dau_app/files/dau.view.lkml?line=58).
3. Open the App DAU Dashboard to see examples of what can be done with this block.
4. Explore your data in the [DAU App - DAU explore](/explore/dau_app/dau).
